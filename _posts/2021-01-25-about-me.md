# Hi! My name is Vassie Dinstel

and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University majoring in Design/Technical Theater with a concentration in Stage Management, and a minor in Leadership Studies. I came in as a double major in English, so this course is both fulfilling my Writing Intensive and letting me relive my love for English. I had never heard of Digital Humanities before, but so far it is very interesting. I created a website using Wix for my Stage Managment portfolio linked [here](https://elizabethdinstel18.wixsite.com/vassiedinstel), and figured adding additional skills such as coding to my resum√© wouldn't hurt.


## Academics

On campus I am a member of Delta Gamma, President of Alpha Psi Omega, and an Orientation Leader. I love being involved on campus. As president I recruit new members each semester, and get to hear from everyone in the fraternity about how I can help them reach their theater goals. Orientation changed my life. I have gained friends all over campus in different years and majors, and it is so rewarding to watch my students grow into themselves. I have done it two summers in a row, and am applying again this year. I have worked as a Leadership Adventure Facilitator both times, and am always proud to rep my team color through the year with a bandana on my backpack.


## Career Interests

I have always wanted to work in entertainment, and I have been working behind the scenes in theater since middle school. When it came time to graduate and choose an intended major, it seemed fitting to stick with it. As much as I love theater, my real passion is for film. The ultimate dream would be working for [_Marvel Studios_](https://www.marvel.com/movies). I love superheroes and with the new release of Marvel tv shows on Disney+, it is perfect for me.
