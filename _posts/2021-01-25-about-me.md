# Hi! My name is Vassie Dinstel

and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University.  

I am a Design/Technical Theater major with a concentration in Stage Management, and a minor in Leadership Studies. I came in as a double major in English, so this course is both fulfilling my Writing Intensive and letting me relive my love for English. I had never heard of Digital Humanities before, but so far it is very interesting. I created a website using Wix for my Stage Managment portfolio linked [here](https://elizabethdinstel18.wixsite.com/vassiedinstel) , and figured adding additional skills such as coding to my resum√© wouldn't hurt.
