# Hi! My name is Vassie Dinstel

and I am a Junior at Christopher Newport University majoring in Design/Technical Theater with a concentration in Stage Management, and a minor in Leadership Studies. I came in as a double major in English, so this course is both fulfilling my Writing Intensive and letting me relive my love for English. I had never heard of Digital Humanities before, but so far it is very interesting. I created a website using Wix for my Stage Managment portfolio linked [here](https://elizabethdinstel18.wixsite.com/vassiedinstel), and figured adding additional skills such as coding to my resum√© wouldn't hurt.

## Career Interests

I have always wanted to work in entertainment, and i have been working behind the scenes in theater since middle school. When it came time to graduate and choose an intended major, it seemed fitting to stick with it. As much as I love theater, my real passion is for film. The ultimate dream would be working for [_Marvel Studios_](https://www.marvel.com/movies). I love super heroes and with the new release of Marvel tv shows on Disney+, that is where I want to work.
