## _Summary_ 
_Visual Haggard_ is a digital archive whose goal is to revitalize the works of Victorian novelist Sir Henry Rider Haggard. It is a combination library 
and gallery, with information on Haggard’s novels and their illustrators, along with an in-depth biography on his life. 
> “The aim of Visual Haggard is to make many, and hopefully someday all, illustrated editions of Haggard's novels available 
in one scholarly resource.” - Kate Holterhoff, _Editor_

## _Design_ 
Ruby and Java stacks. There are five tabs at the top: a link to the home page,  _Novels_, _Illustrators_, _Biography_, and _Editor’s Statement_, as well as a search bar. There are two paragraphs on the page, one describing the project, and one explaining how to use it. I appreciated this because I was immediately introduced to the website. The three images on the bottom of the homepage all lead to the _Novels_ tab, however they show no indication that they are embedded with links. There are no captions or instructions around them, which makes it difficult to use. There are two embedded links that remain on the bottom of the screen, labeled _Tweet at us!_ which leads to Twitter, and _About Us_ which leads to a short description of the two project directors. 

## _Relevance_ 
_Visual Haggard_ combines English literature and art with technology. 

## _Credit_ 
Underneath the _Editor’s Statement_, there is an acknowledgement section, thanking someone for editing a previous version of the project. There is also an 
expression of gratitude toward people’s ongoing support of the project, although it does not state if it was financially. Finally, there is a works cited 
header, which credits roughly forty websites for the information.

## _Findings_
The _Novels_ and _Illustrators_ tabs both use images in alphabetical order to lead to specific works. Each image can lead to further images, 
becoming a nesting doll, but there is a trail of sites that appear at the top so you can easily maneuver back to the original image. (Shown above)
The  _Biography_ tab is simply paragraphs about Haggard’s life. While there are headings, they are given little importance over the other words; they are 
numbered with Roman numerals, but in the same size font and not in bold or italics, so they are easily looked over. This makes it difficult for someone merely 
skimming to understand the content of what they are reading. Finally, there is the _Editor’s Statement_ tab, which consists of twenty lengthy paragraphs broken 
up by three subheadings. In this day in age, no one is going to read all of that. Overall, the site is easily navigated, with an extensive library and background 
on his life and contributions. This is an excellent use of Digital Humanities to explore the works of Haggard. If the tab is not full screen, or you are using a 
cellphone, the tabs at the top do not appear, so you have to use the images at the bottom to link to _Novels_ or type in the search bar. All other information is
inaccessible. It could benefit from a mobile friendly version, more concise language, and more subheadings within the Biography and Editor’s Statement.
