### _Summary_
_Records of Early English Drama_  is a website organizing data about performances, patrons, venues, and troupes in England before 1642. They focus on traveling medieval and renaissance entertainment, who performed, attended, and where the performances took place.

###  _Design_
This database is organized by tabs at the top labeled _Patrons_, _Venues_, _Troupes_, _Events_, Bibliography_, _Maps_,  _About_, _Tagged Records_, _OTRA_, and _Login_. Underneath is a gallery of clickable images, each leading to a different tab. However there is no indication to which tab it leads, and they are in no particular order. At the bottom of the homepage there is a map of the UK, the same one found in the _Venues_ tab.

From _Patrons_ to _Events_ the tab leads to a different page with a unique search system at the top, and an alphabetical list underneath, as seen above. In addition to this, the _Venues_  tab, seen below, has an interactive map at the top that when clicked, gives more information about the venue including an overview, performance history, and additional images.

### _Relevance_
This project incorporates mapping to better depict the location of the venue in England. It also uses interactive images that link to different informational pages. 

### _Credit_
This project has a Bibliography tab that lists sources by subject, with an option for all bibliographic sources in alphabetical order.

### _Findings_
The website did not render on mobile devices. Each tab has general information, and each name leads to an in-depth description of the patron, venue, troupe, or event.
