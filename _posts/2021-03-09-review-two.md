### _Summary_
_Records of Early English Drama_  is a website organizing data about performances, patrons, venues, and troupes in England before 1642. They focus on traveling medieval and renaissance entertainment, who performed, attended, and where the performances took place.

###  _Design_
This database is organized by tabs at the top labeled _Patrons_, _Venues_, _Troupes_, _Events_, _Bibliography_, _Maps_, _About_, _Tagged Records_, _OTRA_, and _Login_. Underneath is a gallery of clickable images, seen above, each leading to a different tab. However there is no indication to which tab it leads, and they are in no particular order. This makes them a difficult way to navigate the website, as the user is unsure which tab they are being led to from the image. At the bottom of the homepage there is a map of the UK, the same one found in the _Venues_ tab.

From _Patrons_ to _Events_ the tab leads to a different page with a unique search system at the top, and an alphabetical list underneath, as seen above. In addition to this, the _Venues_  tab, seen below, has an interactive map at the top that when clicked, gives more information about the venue including an overview, performance history, and additional images. The first page showing general information with links to more specific details about one topic, exemplified below, is a useful design choice because the information is not only on one overwhelming page.

### _Relevance_
This is a prime example of combining history, theater, theater history, and technology. Using intense research to make it more available to everyone. It incorporates mapping to better depict the location of the venue in England. It also uses interactive images that link to different informational pages. 

### _Credit_
This project has a Bibliography tab that lists sources by subject, with an option for all bibliographic sources in alphabetical order. Sources are also listed at the bottom of each page.

### _Findings_

The _Patrons_, _Venues_, _Troupes_, and _Events_ tabs all lead to an alphabetical list of general information that, when clicked, leads to an in-depth description of the patron, venue, troupe, or event. This made the site easy to navigate and I was able to learn more information about specific areas. The amount of data would be overwhelming, but the organization through tabs, alphabetical ordering, and advanced search engines makes it easy to use.

The _Maps_ tab leads to three images of Antiquarian maps of different locations in Great Britain. They are illegible, but the description gives more background on the map, and it is possible to zoom in to better see the intricate details.

Overall, _Records of Early English Drama_ is a database providing information about English theater before the 1640s. The amount of information is impressive, as is the site's ease of use. The site does not render on mobile devices, which makes it difficult for those without access to a computer to use, thus hindering its accessibility. Aside from this and the clickable images that lead to unidentified tabs, everything is clearly labeled and the altogether use of the site is intuitive. This is a paradigm of Digital Humanities bringing previously unknown research to your fingertips.
