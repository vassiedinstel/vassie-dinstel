# Grant Process Reflection Post

## Project

Our project is creating a Virtual Reality(VR) walkable scene of _A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte_ by George Seurat. The project incorporates art and technology, two things we are passionate about. Being able to become a part of the painting is something we have talked about, so allowing us to create a project in which the viewer is transported into the artwork was very exciting. 

### Project Transformation

When we first sat down and discussed what we wanted, my partner suggested using VR. That brought us to the idea of art in VR, and we ended on the dynamic scene from one of our favorite movies, _Ferris Bueller’s Day Off_. We decided on a standstill scene of 3D models that could be fully explored and walkable along the viewers path. We got to work researching VR, the painting, and similar projects. Finding “The Van Gogh Experience” on YouTube for VR brought a whole new perspective to our project. We decided to add stationary movement, with water moving, dogs jumping, and kids running. The entire 3D model would move in place, generating a lifelike experience. We also added sounds of the scene. When the viewer walked near the river, they would hear rushing water. When meandering through the crowd they would hear muted chatter, laughing, and animal sounds. The 3D models in VR combined with the added ambiance of subtle music and movement would create a lifelike experience like no other.

### Similar Projects

Van Gogh’s _Starry Night_ being brought to life with movement, music, and 3D models was the most similar, and actually inspired us to create a more interactive experience. Instead of having a preset path that the VR carries the viewer through, we wanted a fully explorable scene, complete with stationary movement and scenic sound effects.  

### Writing the Grant

Collaborating with a partner allowed for more ideas and work to be done. I learned more about the process of writing a grant, and the different pieces required. I had never heard of an environmental scan, and found it helpful leading into the grant narrative.

## Class Reflection

Digital Humanities is undefined. I can now recognize what is or is not, and I appreciate the time and effort made by digital humanists. Once I reviewed my first DH project, I developed a deeper understanding of what it consisted of, and what to look for. I enjoyed the readings, especially the ones that specifically focused on DH projects specifically. Exploring projects while being guided by a rubric on what to look for helped me appreciate the design of the projects. 

Coding the blogs was my favorite part of the class. I felt like a professional hacker whenever I typed a code from memory, and it was a fun way to pass the time. Reviewing a project in its entirety and then writing about what was good and what could be improved allowed me to identify what DH was, and how it can be its best. 

The TEI Coding was a little more difficult, as it was a more “real” code. The application was daunting, and I avoided using it until the very end, which hurt me in the long run. I did learn a new skill, and I had fun doing it!

Overall, I have grown as a student at CNU. I learned more about a field I had never explored, and took part in a real DH project. I learned a new skill, and a new way of writing. I am now not just a student in a digital humanities class, but a digital humanist.
