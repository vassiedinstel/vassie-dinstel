# Review on TEI Coding 

### _The Yellow Wall-paper_

My portion of Stetson’s _The Yellow Wall-paper_ begins with description of the wallpaper. She uses words like horror, confusion, and grotesques. Focusing on the directions of the patterns, the faded spots where the sun has beat down on the wall, and how confusing it all is. Then the mood changes. Her confusion becomes fear. Stetson separates single sentences into their own paragraphs, giving them punching importance. She has to write this to feel relief, but John doesn’t like it. He won’t let her visit others and he explains away her feelings, so she learns to do the same. He encourages her to “take care of [herself] for his sake.” She must get better, but it has to be while confined within the yellow wallpaper.

### TEI on Paper

The Google Doc exercise was helpful to identify the kind of features I would be encoding. I liked it being online because I could have two tabs open, one with my annotated doc and one with Oxygen, so I could see what needed to be marked right beside the application. It also made it easily accessible to others in my class and my professor for review.

I separated paragraphs by color in order to make sure I marked the end of the paragraph even if it went to the next page. It also helped me code one paragraph at a time when I transferred it to Oxygen. The most commonly used special features in my sections were words crossed-out with replacements added above, and em-dashes. While at first identifying them was difficult, I was quickly able to highlight and comment without missing anything.


### Oxygen

The final boss. This was so intimidating that I coded everything in a separate Google doc before putting it into Oxygen:

In the doc, I was able to copy and paste the code from the syllabus and insert my words easily. I first did all the paragraph beginning and ends, then went paragraph by paragraph, coding the various features. 

Moving to Oxygen, there were so many tags I didn’t know where to actually write the encoded text, but after watching the recorded lecture and deleting the unnecessary tags, it became clear. I only had three error codes, and two of them were that Oxygen didn’t like the copy and pasted quotation marks, so I deleted it and typed it directly in Oxygen. With my work beforehand, I was able to completely validate my code within ten minutes. This is my final product:

I am proud of the progress I have made so far, and the fact that I even did this. While daunting at first, taking it one step at a time, and the code being provided for us (very helpful) I was able to complete this project and feel like I learned something from it.
